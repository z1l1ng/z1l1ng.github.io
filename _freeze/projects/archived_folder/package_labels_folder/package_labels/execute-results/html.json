[GraphicRiver](https://graphicriver.net/) is a part of the Envato Market, marketplace for digital assets that offers a diverse array of label designs that serve as valuable resources for businesses and creators. By examining the design trends and characteristics of these labels, we can uncover key insights into what makes a label visually appealing and effective in a commercial context. Using data collected from GraphicRiver and published on Kaggle, this dataset includes 622 rows and 9 columns, with each row representing a package label. Key columns include price, number of sales, rating, number of reviews, and the release date.\n\nThis project will integrate the design principles learned in the course *Theater 140 - Introduction to Design for Performance* with statistical programming techniques to analyze label design trends on Graphic River. The analysis will identify common features, text elements, and other covariates that contribute to a label's popularity. I will then apply these findings to design my own product label. To deepen the exploration, I plan to compare my design to an AI-generated label based on the same analytical insights, offering a perspective on human versus machine creativity in design.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlabels |> \n  group_by(year) |>\n  count(year) |>\n  filter(n > 25) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n)) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2() +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of Designs Published by Year\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](package_labels_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0px; overflow-y: scroll; height:200px; overflow-x: scroll; width:100%; \"><table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;position: sticky; top:0; background-color: #FFFFFF;\"> year </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;position: sticky; top:0; background-color: #FFFFFF;\"> n </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2011 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2012 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 41 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2013 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 25 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2014 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 10 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2015 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 53 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2016 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 78 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2017 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 141 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2018 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 76 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2019 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 49 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2020 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 101 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2021 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 35 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2022 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 11 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2023 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that the graph is filtered to include only years with more than 25 package labels.

Both were created by the same designer, [mihalymm](https://graphicriver.net/user/mihalymm/portfolio), showcasing their strong presence in this dataset. Using this information, let's explore how frequently specific creators appear across the years.\n\n# Most Popular Creator & Sales Strategy\n\nFor the labels that we have let's see if a majority of them were created by a common user or not. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0px; overflow-y: scroll; height:200px; overflow-x: scroll; width:100%; \"><table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;position: sticky; top:0; background-color: #FFFFFF;\"> creator </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;position: sticky; top:0; background-color: #FFFFFF;\"> n </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> graphicgrow </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 118 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Plexa_Designs </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 65 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Dkgray </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 59 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> jumpingideas </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 46 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> packgallery </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 41 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> mihalymm </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 34 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> monostudio </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 23 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Artsoldiers </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 19 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> joiaco </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 14 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ArtBeatDesigns </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe top 10 creators with the most designs on Graphic River in our dataset are shown above, we can see that [graphicgrow](https://graphicgrow.com/) is the the top creator that created 118 of the 622 designs that we are analyzing. [Plexa_Designs](https://plexadesigns.com/) is 2nd with 65 designs and [Dkgray](https://graphicriver.net/user/dkgray/portfolio) is 3rd with 59 designs. \n\nLet's further look at these creators to explore their sale strategies.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlabels |>\n  filter(creator == \"graphicgrow\" | creator == \"Plexa_Designs\" | creator == \"Dkgray\") |>\n  group_by(creator) |>\n  mutate(price = parse_number(price)) |>\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_boxplot(aes(x = creator, y = price, fill = creator), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Price & Creator\",\n    x = \"Creator\",\n    y = \"Price\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](package_labels_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis boxplot may not be the most visually appealing, but it provides valuable insights. We can see that *graphicgrow* sells nearly all designs for \\$30, with only two exceptions sold for less. *Plexa_Designs* operates at a higher price range, selling most designs for \\$89, excluding three that are priced even higher. Dkgray is the most interesting, whose designs are priced between \\$10 and \\$25, showcasing a unique pricing strategy.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|creator       | total_sold| median_price| total_profit|\n|:-------------|----------:|------------:|------------:|\n|Dkgray        |        780|           16|        12480|\n|Plexa_Designs |        621|           89|        55269|\n|graphicgrow   |        918|           30|        27540|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAlthough *graphicgrow* has the most designs on Graphic River, *Dkgray* has sold the most designs among these top three creators, which could be attributed to the accessible price range of their designs. Based on the median price for these creators, it is evident that *Plexa_Designs* has generated the highest revenue. Next, let's examine when these creators were most active in releasing new designs.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlabels |>\n  filter(creator == \"graphicgrow\" | creator == \"Plexa_Designs\" | creator == \"Dkgray\") |>\n  group_by(creator) |>\n  count(year) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = creator), stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of Designs per Year by Creator\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    fill = \"Creator\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](package_labels_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n2017 was an active year for *graphicgrow*, followed by a gradual decline in designs, ultimately tapering off after 2021. *Plexa_Designs* began releasing designs in 2016, peaked in 2017, and steadily decreased activity thereafter, with no new designs in 2022. Dkgray entered the scene in 2018, with 2020 being the year they released the most designs. Interestingly, some of these creators have since transitioned to operating their own websites.\n\n# Insight Into Labels\n\nNow that we have an understanding of the price ranges, release years, and other characteristics of the most popular designs, let's explore which product labels are the most popular in terms of their intended use.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1234)\nwordcloud(\n    words = wordfreq$word,\n    freq = wordfreq$n,\n    max.words = 90,\n    random.order = FALSE,\n    random.color = TRUE,\n    scale = c(3.2, .9),\n    rot.per = .50,\n    colors = brewer.pal(5, \"Dark2\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](package_labels_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0px; overflow-y: scroll; height:200px; overflow-x: scroll; width:100%; \"><table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;position: sticky; top:0; background-color: #FFFFFF;\"> word </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;position: sticky; top:0; background-color: #FFFFFF;\"> n </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> supplement </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 113 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> tea </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 26 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> coffee </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 20 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> shopping </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 20 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> oil </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 19 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> food </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 18 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> honey </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 18 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> juice </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 17 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> wine </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 17 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> cosmetic </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 16 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> gift </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 16 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> protein </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 16 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> soap </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 16 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> dog </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 15 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> bar </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> chocolate </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 12 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> premium </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 11 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> whey </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 11 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> beer </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 10 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> business </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> can </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> drink </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> fruit </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> hand </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> nuts </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> powder </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe most common design categories include supplements, tea, coffee, shopping, and oil.

These designs are typically divided into three parts: the front, which features the company name and product; one side, which includes a supplement facts label and a barcode; and the other side, which contains a few lines about benefits, company information, and suggested use. The dimensions generally range between 2–3 inches in height and 6–8 inches in length. These designs also have very BOLD fonts and colors.\n\nFor the files itself these designs are all layered and usually come with 2-3 different templates. Everything is editable which I think is the most appealing aspect, such as size, color, and fonts. File types consists of photoshop documents, psd, adobe illustrator, ai, encapsulated postscript, eps, and portable document format (pdfs).\n\nFor my design I wanted to keep it clean by not using too many colors, and a single font. I like things not cluttered and simple, if you could not tell by my theme choice in graphs and colors. Below is my first label design. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](matchalabel.png){width=1000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nLabel for matcha flavored protein powder supplement jar, that is 7.5in by 2.75in created in Canva.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](matchabottle.png){width=900}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOn the right bottle we have the nutrition label, ingredients, and barcode. At the top of the left bottle, we have the company name that is producing the product which is *ZZupplements* and a little about the company, or customizable to be about the product itself as well. Front and center we have the most important view, what the customer sees and what your brand is known for. I decided to go with POWER PROTEIN POWDER for repetition as well as a good view of PROTEIN POWDER which is what my product is. I also decided the bottom third to be green to match the flavor for that *clean* look I am looking to achieve. As well as a photo to represent the flavor so people don't have to look so hard for the flavor. Similarly, I created a label for the flavor strawberry using the same concept. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](strawberrylabel.png){width=1000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nLabel for strawberry flavored protein powder supplement jar, that is 7.5in by 2.75in created in Canva.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](strawberrybottle.png){width=900}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI would not sell these designs but put them out on the internet for free as inspiration to others considering my designs are not layered, is only available in pdf format and not easily editable. \n\nElements of Design: \n\n- Color: Color of bottle to represent flavor of protein powder, the shade of my green and red are bright and welcoming opposed to sharp and cautionary. \n\n_ Lines: Sharp line of bottom third of color for cleaniness look, labels and barcodes are all straight, and words are also all zero degrees for \"straightness\"\n\n- Shapes: The images on both bottles are illustrated and not real photos, adds to the overall feel of the bottle. \n\n# AI Implementation\n\nWith my knowledge of package deigns now and having some experience with designing my own package label, I am curious how AI is able to interpret and design these labels.\n\nWith this prompt \"Create an Image: A 7.5in by 2.75in design for a package label. The company is ZZupplements, the product is Power Protein Powder, the flavor is matcha, this is a 100% whey product.\" I utilized three different AI models to create these labels.\n\n## ChatGPT\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chatgpt.webp){width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis image was generated with our prompt in ChatGPT. I should've been more specific because I wanted the label itself however I got two jars with this design. It is really interesting because the font used for \"POWER PROTEIN POWDER\" is almost identical, I guess I am generic. Notice how some of the words on the label are blurry, we can't really tell what it is saying. \n\n- Color: Color of label to represent flavor of protein powder, also uses a shade of green for matcha and the matcha powder. Background is a darker grey with shadows. Very interesting that a blue is used as well.\n\n- Lines: Sharp lines are used, labels and barcodes are all straight, and words are also all zero degrees for \"straightness\".\n\n- Shapes: There a couple of rectangles that are different colors to help some of the more important words.\n\n## Google Gemini\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](gemini.jpeg){width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFor this AI generated image we used Google Gemini, it also gave our label to us in bottle form, where the bottle is primarily green and the background is green. It is interesting to see that even though I gave it Power Protein Powder it was only able to somewhat put it on the image. There is just some legible English on this design. \n\n- Color: Color of label to represent flavor of protein powder, also uses a shade of green matcha. Background is green. Bottle is also green just fully incorporating the matcha vibe. \n\n- Lines: Sharp lines for cleaniness look again, everything is formatted nicely. There 2 curved lines for a flowly look. \n\n- Shapes: A rectangle is used with text inside as this also adds to the sharp lines. Dots around the curved lines.\n\n## Canva Magic Media \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](magicmedia.png){width=540}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nCanva Magic Media was used to create this image. Our label is also in bottle form however there is no curve in this container. This is probably the most unique image that we generated. Again there is no legible English on this design. \n\n- Color: Color of the label is white, also uses a shade of green matcha. Background is grey, the bottle is two different shades of green, with a green cap, there are more shades of green used in this label compared to all of the others.\n\n- Lines: Are not all sharp anymore, we have curves on the side kind of wrapping an image\n\nAlthough without a more specific font we can see the AI is more useful as inspiration and not the final product. These images aren't available in psd form which mean if you're looking for a label that you can adjust it would give you more work converting it into a psd and creating the layers yourself compared to designing your own. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis project allowed me to apply my design knowledge with an analysis done in R. By analyzing top designs on GraphicRiver, I was able to identify key trends such as price, layouts and bold yet minimalistic styles, all of which I integrated into my own label designs. Creating labels for matcha and strawberry-flavored protein powders enabled me to meet the project’s creative deliverables by demonstrating application of the skills learned in class. Additionally, exploring AI tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Canva Magic Media showcased my ability to leverage technology. This experience not only enhanced my design skills but also helped me understand the intersection of creativity and technology, a crucial step in achieving my long-term goals in design and beyond.",
