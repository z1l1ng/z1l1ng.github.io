Hi! I'm Ziling, however most know me as Z! I'm currently a senior math major with a statistics and data science concentration at St. Olaf College. I'm also #2 on the NCAA women's basketball team here. Outside of my commitments as a college student I love socializing with friends, going to sporting events and trying new foods! This is a place where I'll be sharing some of my work!
