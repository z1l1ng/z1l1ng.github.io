### Fun Fact #1

I super enjoy going to sporting events, particularly basketball and baseball games. The atmosphere in the arena and the intensity of the competition is super fun. I went to my first MLB game this summer and was absolutely hooked.

### Fun Fact #2

My second fun fact is that I love going to concerts and music! My very first concert was in 2021 and since then I've been to 24 total concerts and 1 3-day long festival. I have a shoe that I call my concert shoe in which I get artists to sign. I was also featured in a YouTube short video posted by Dean Lewis that has 5+ million views and 315k likes.
